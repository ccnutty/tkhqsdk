# Example: `with-solana`

This example walks through the following:

- Creation of a new Turnkey wallet with a new Solana account
- Monitoring of devnet tokens landing on that address
- Construction of a transaction sending the funds out with the `@turnkey/solana` signer
- Creating, minting, and transferring a SPL token using Turnkey

You can try this example quickly on Stackblitz. Follow the instructions below --> [Stackblitz Instructions](#6-stackblitz-example)

## Getting started

### 1/ Cloning the example

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed locally; we recommend using Node v18+.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tkhq/sdk
$ cd sdk/
$ corepack enable  # Install `pnpm`
$ pnpm install -r  # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run build-all  # Compile source code
$ cd examples/with-solana/
```

### 2/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
- An organization ID

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `BASE_URL`
- `ORGANIZATION_ID`

You can specify an existing Turnkey Solana address if you have one already:

```
SOLANA_ADDRESS=<your Turnkey Solana address>
```

Note that this is optional: the script gives you a fresh one if you don't specify one in your `.env.local` file.

### 3/ Running the script

```bash
$ pnpm start
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
creating a new Solana wallet in your Turnkey organization...

New Solana wallet created!
- Name: Solana Wallet 6527
- Wallet ID: 7f0f7d49-22e3-5b34-8192-db3df83a0759
- Solana address: G6fEj2pt4YYAxLS8JAsY5BL6hea7Fpe8Xyqscg2e7pgp

Your new Solana address: "G6fEj2pt4YYAxLS8JAsY5BL6hea7Fpe8Xyqscg2e7pgp"

ðŸ’¸ Your onchain balance is at 0! To continue this demo you'll need devnet funds! You can use:
- The faucet in this example: `pnpm run faucet`
- The official Solana CLI: `solana airdrop 1 G6fEj2pt4YYAxLS8JAsY5BL6hea7Fpe8Xyqscg2e7pgp`
- Any online faucet (e.g. https://faucet.solana.com/)

```

Note: if you have a consensus-related policy resembling the following

```
{
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.count() >= 2"
}
```

then the script will await consensus to be met. Specifically, the script will attempt to poll for activity completion per the `activityPoller` config passed to the `TurnkeyServerSDK`. If consensus still isn't met during this period, then the resulting `Consensus Needed` error will be caught, and the script will prompt the user to indicate when consensus has been met. At that point, the script will continue.

### 4/ Running the advanced script (multiple versioned transactions)

```bash
$ pnpm advanced
```

The output will resemble the following:

```
Using existing Solana address from ENV: "G6fEj2pt4YYAxLS8JAsY5BL6hea7Fpe8Xyqscg2e7pgp"
? Number of transactions: 3
? 1. Destination address: tkhqC9QX2gkqJtUFk2QKhBmQfFyyqZXSpr73VFRi35C
? 1. Amount (in Lamports) to send to tkhqC9QX2gkqJtUFk2QKhBmQfFyyqZXSpr73VFRi35C: 111

```

### 5/ Running the SPL token script (create, mint, transfer)

```bash
$ pnpm token-transfer
```

The output will resemble the following:

```
