# Solana ü§ù Passkeys

This repo contains a sample application **for demonstration purposes only**, walking through how to create sub-organizations, create a wallet, and sign with the [`@turnkey/solana`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/solana) signer (with transactions sponsored by the parent org!), using passkeys. Please feel free to play with this example and file an issue if there are improvements to be made! ‚ù§Ô∏è

The flow showcases 3 ways to make requests to Turnkey:

- the initial request to create a new [sub-organization](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/sub-organizations) is authenticated in the NextJS backend with an API signature (using `API_PUBLIC_KEY`/`API_PRIVATE_KEY` from your `.env.local` file)
- the request to log back in is signed on the frontend with your passkey, but it's passed to the NextJS backend as a signed request (the body, stamp, and url are POSTed). This lets the backend submit this request on your behalf, get your sub-organization ID, and fetch details about your wallet (parent organizations have read-only access to their sub-organizations).
- the request to sign a message is done 100% client-side via a Turnkey Solana signer (see [@turnkey/solana](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/solana)): it's signed with your passkey, and submitted from the browser to the Turnkey API directly.
- the request to sign a transaction is also done on the client-side, but the transaction is initially created on the server-side and signed by the fee payer, which is a wallet belonging to the parent org.

If you want to see a Solana demo with API keys instead of passkeys, head to the example [`with-solana`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-solana).

You can try this example quickly on Stackblitz -- follow the instructions below

## Getting started

### 1/ Clone or fork this repo

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed locally; we recommend using Node v18+.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tkhq/sdk
$ cd sdk/
$ corepack enable  # Install `pnpm`
$ pnpm install -r  # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run build-all  # Compile source code
$ cd examples/with-solana-passkeys/
```

### 2/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
- An organization ID

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your API private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPID=localhost` # replace with domain in production
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_SIGN_URL=http://localhost:3000/api` # replace with backend URL in production
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_PAYER_ADDRESS="<fee payer address>"` # parent org wallet that pays for fees

### 3/ Running the app

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

This command will start a NextJS app on localhost. If you navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser, you can follow the prompts to create a sub organization, create a private key for the newly created sub-organization, and sign a message using your passkey with a Solana custom account!

### 4/ Stackblitz Example

You will need to create a stackblitz 

Example Link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-h5pmnu

#### Prerequisites
To use the example you need the following
- Turnkey Organization
- API key for the root user (both public and private key needed) 
- Solana wallet for Parent org (created within turnkey UI) 
- Airdrop SOL to parent org wallet using devnet faucet ‚Üí https://faucet.solana.com/ 


#### Set Env Variables
Set the following environment variables in .env.local
- API_PUBLIC_KEY ‚Üí Public key of your API associated with root user
- API_PRIVATE_KEY ‚Üí Private key of your API associated with root user 
- NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZTION_ID ‚Üí org ID of the turnkey organization that you‚Äôre using
- NEXT_PUBLIC_RPID --> this should be prefilled with the value `local-credentialless.webcontainer.io` which is the RPID required in the stackblitz environment
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_SIGN_URL ‚Üí fill this out with the url in the browser of stackblitz followed by ‚Äú/api‚Äù --> for example: https://stackblitzstartersh5pmnu-0bej--3000--134daa3c.local-credentialless.webcontainer.io/api
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_PAYER_ADDRESS --> the address of the solana address with airdropped funds


#### Directions to use
- run `npm install && npm run build && npm run dev"
- follow example flow
