# Example: `with-federated-passkeys`

This example shows how to create a sub organization and facilitate creating a private key for the user's sub organization with Turnkey.

## Getting started

### 1/ Cloning the example

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed locally; we recommend using Node v16+.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tkhq/sdk
$ cd sdk/
$ corepack enable  # Install `pnpm`
$ pnpm install -r  # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run build-all  # Compile source code
$ cd examples/with-federated-passkeys/
```

### 2/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://turnkey.readme.io/docs/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
- An organization ID

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your API private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `BASE_URL`
- `ORGANIZATION_ID`

### 3/ Running the app

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

This command will run a nextjs app on localhost:3000. If you navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser, you can follow the prompts to create a sub organization and private key for the newly created sub organization.
