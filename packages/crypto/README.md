# @turnkey/crypto

This package consolidates some common cryptographic utilities used across our applications, particularly primitives related to keys, encryption, and decryption. For react-native you will need to polyfill our random byte generation by importing react-native-get-random-values: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-get-random-values

```
import 'react-native-get-random-values'
```
